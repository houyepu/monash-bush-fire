The currently signed in is accessible by the global variable "currentUser" if they are logged in.

-- Signed in user's index in User List --

-- User pinpoints --
Each user's pinpoints are accessible under the user's "watchList", stored in "currentUser.watchList".

Pinpoints that are triggered to alert authorised users are stored in the key "KEY_PIN_POINTS".
